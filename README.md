==================

A Tomasulo-based processor system in VHDL

Developed in summer 2011 for USC's Digital Design Tools & Techniques (EE645) course.

Implemented a Tomasulo-based processor system in VHDL on a Nexys 3 FPGA. The architecture supported basic MIPS ISA instructions, complete with IFQ, dispatch units, BPB, RAS, FRL, PRF, CFC, functional units, CDB, instruction and data caches, ROB, LSQ, store buffer.
